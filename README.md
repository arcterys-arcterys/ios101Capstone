## Overview

### Description

An app that allows the reading community to tag a book's content, scan their collection, and track their reading stats all in one user-friendly spot.

### App Evaluation
-**Mobile:** Utilizes camera to allow you to scan a book's ISBN to search and log books.
-**Story:** An app that lets users log their TBR on their phones, and the book database includes community sourced content tags that allow users to determine if this book is the right fit for them. It also allows users to track their reading habits.
-**Market:** There are similar apps in the market, such as Library Thing and Storygraph. While Library Thing has the key features, it makes you add a book to your catalog before you can see the tags. Additionally, Library Thing's UI is lacking. The potential userbase is those who use Storygraph and Library Thing, which is a solid population of tech-savvy readers.
-**Habit:** This app isn't addictive. Users contribute tags to the app. A user would open this app whenver they are looking for a new read, so roughly once a month.
-**Scope:** V1 would just be searching books and adding tags. V2 would enable scanning and progress tracking. V3 would provide further reading stats. For the scope of this project, the app would likely have to use dummy data and not have a full back-end, but it would be engaging to make and serve as a foundation for future work.
