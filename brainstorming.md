Top Two: B, E
 APP EVALUATION CRITERIA

BookTags
    Mobile: Utilizes camera to allow you to scan a book's ISBN to search and log books.
    Story: An app that lets users log their TBR on their phones, and the book database includes community sourced content tags that allow users to determine if this book is the right fit for them. It also allows users to track their reading habits.
    Market: There are similar apps in the market, such as Library Thing and Storygraph. While Library Thing has the key features, it makes you add a book to your catalog before you can see the tags. Additionally, Library Thing's UI is lacking. The potential userbase is those who use Storygraph and Library Thing, which is a solid population of tech-savvy readers.
    Habit: This app isn't addictive. Users contribute tags to the app. A user would open this app whenver they are looking for a new read, so roughly once a month. 
    Scope: V1 would just be searching books and adding tags. V2 would enable scanning and progress tracking. V3 would provide further reading stats. For the scope of this project, the app would likely have to use dummy data and not have a full back-end, but it would be engaging to make and serve as a foundation for future work.
    
Snamagotchi
    Mobile: Utilizes fitness/steps to help pet grow. Camera lets you place your pet in your environment.
    Story: A simple idle/clicker tamagotchi app where users can take care of a pet snail. Utilizes health data (steps) to encourage players towards a healthy lifestyle
    Market: There are a multitude of similar apps, especially Pokemon Go with the step counting and AR features. The market isn't as wide, but its a family friendly app that would provide a bit of novelty with the snail main character.
    Habit: This app isn't addictive. They'd likely open it once or twice a day, to check on their snail friend.
    Scope: V1 would implement the snail and their growth related to step count. V2 would implement camera feature. While the scope of this project is small and not the most technologically ambitious, it could be completed relatively quickly and be a productive playground for further familiarization with iOS dev.
